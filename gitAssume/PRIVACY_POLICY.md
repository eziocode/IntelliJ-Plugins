# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 5, 2025**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the Git Assume Unchanged plugin ("the Plugin") handles user information.

## Data Collection

**The Plugin does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage information.**

Specifically, the Plugin does NOT:
- Collect any personal information
- Track user behavior or usage statistics
- Send any data to external servers
- Store any information outside your local machine
- Access any files beyond those you explicitly select
- Require internet connectivity
- Use analytics or tracking services

## How the Plugin Works

The Plugin operates entirely locally on your machine:

1. **File Operations**: Only processes files you explicitly select through the IDE interface
2. **Git Commands**: Executes standard Git commands (`git update-index`) locally
3. **Notifications**: Displays success/error messages only within your IDE
4. **No External Communication**: Never connects to external servers or services

## Data Storage

The Plugin does NOT store any data. All operations are performed using:
- Your local Git repository
- Your IDE's built-in notification system
- Standard Git index files (managed by Git itself)

## Third-Party Services

The Plugin does NOT integrate with or use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

## Permissions

The Plugin requires the following permissions:
- **Git Access**: To execute Git commands on your behalf
- **File System Access**: To read file paths you select (standard IDE permission)
- **Notification Display**: To show success/error messages in your IDE

These permissions are used solely for the Plugin's core functionality and nothing else.

## Children's Privacy

The Plugin does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above.

## Open Source

The Plugin is open source. You can review the complete source code to verify these privacy claims.

## Contact

For questions about this Privacy Policy or the Plugin:
- **GitHub**: Open an issue on the project repository
- **Email**: support@github.com

## Your Rights

Since the Plugin does not collect any data, there is no personal information to:
- Access
- Modify
- Delete
- Export

## Compliance

This Plugin complies with:
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- Other privacy regulations (by not collecting any data)

## Summary

**In short: This Plugin is completely private. It runs entirely on your local machine and never collects, stores, or transmits any of your data.**
